# Pangeo@HPC for beginners

This is a collection of notebooks about the deployment and usage of [Pangeo](http://pangeo-data.org) ecosystem on HPC clusters.
The notebooks target users that have an intermediate knowledge about this ecosystem and but that would like to distribute calculations on HPC systems. 

To learn what pangeo is, try the following [tutorial](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-tutorial)

I hope this repository will help you getting to familiar with pangeo on HPC systems, and helps you having a **fun time** with your big-data set!

**AP: Do you expect prerequisite knowledge of some of the tools, if yes, say so...**
